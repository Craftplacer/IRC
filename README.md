Craftplacer.IRC is a modern .NET Standard 2.1 IRC library built from scratch. It aims to support [RFC 1459](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1459.html), [RFC 2812](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2812) and [IRCv3](https://ircv3.net/) specifications.
Unlike other .NET IRC libraries, this one tries to stay up to date with the new conventions of both .NET and IRC.
